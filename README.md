# Project Lead At Apnito

Apnito is a startup where with the help of its experienced team members, provide you with the right path and help both students and professionals to create and deploy projects and make them industry ready for jobs or to start a new career in various fields.

I have done two work there:

2. I have guided the students who joined Apnito for project based learning in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
